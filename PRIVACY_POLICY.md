# Privacy Policy for Hungarian Culture Exam App

Last updated: November 16, 2025

## 1. General Information

Hungarian Culture Exam ("the App") is an educational application that helps users prepare for the Hungarian Cultural Knowledge Exam.
The App does not collect, store, transmit, or process any personal data.

The App is designed for general educational use and does not require user registration or an account.

## 2. Subscriptions and Payments

The App offers an optional auto-renewable subscription.
All payments, refunds, and billing operations are processed exclusively through Google Play in accordance with the Google Play Terms of Service.

We do not have access to:

- your name
- your email address
- your Google account
- your payment information
- your Google Play purchase history

Google Play provides us only with a purchase token, which is used internally to unlock premium content on your device.

## Subscription Verification Data

To provide premium features, the app uses an anonymous user identifier and technical subscription data:

- Anonymous User ID (UUID) generated on the device and stored locally.
- Subscription technical data: purchase token, product ID, platform, and subscription status.

No personal data (such as email, name, or contact information) is collected. The technical data is sent to our backend solely for payment verification with the platform provider (e.g., Google Play). The backend stores only the minimum required fields to maintain subscription status:

- userId
- productId
- purchaseToken
- platform
- expireAt
- isActive

Data is used exclusively to verify payments and determine access to premium content. If the subscription is inactive or expired, premium content may be restricted until payment status is confirmed.

## 3. Data Collection

The App:

- does NOT collect personal data
- does NOT use analytics or tracking tools
- does NOT store data on external servers
- does NOT request permissions beyond those required for app functionality
- processes all study progress and settings locally on the user's device

## 4. Sharing of Data

Since the App does not collect data, it does not share anything with third parties.

## 5. Children's Privacy

The App is intended for users aged 13+.
Since the App does not collect any personal information, it is compliant with COPPA/GDPR-K requirements.
